## FansAlsoConnect

This project allows users to see how the "Related Artists" section of Spotify branches out and to find new artists

## Dependencies

It is built on Python/Django. It uses Tekore to interface with Spotify and Networkx + Bokeh to build the graphs.

## Future Ideas

- Shortest path between 2 artists
- Shortest path between all artists with a playlist as input
- Organize tree based on artist popularity and genre
